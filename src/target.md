LibreCar is a fully reconfigurable test instrument that provides all the hardware, gateware, firmware, and software you will need to work withâ€”and, indeed, to master Automotive domain. Below are a few of the challenges to which one should be able to apply LibreCar to:

* Protocol analysis for Automotive protocols like Diagnostics, XCP and DLT. 
    * Useful for both educators/students too understand the current working of automotive ECU and standard autmotive protocols.


* Creating your own custom Automotive ECU: LibreCar provides Amaranth gateware that allows you to create CAN and Ethernet devices in gateware, firmware, or a combination of the two. 
    * Useful for Automotive manufacturers/suppliers to develop solutions that they can tweak it to better suite their product needs and are no longer tied to ASIC offering from semiconductor manufacturers.

    
* Security research: LibreCar hardware and gateware simplify the emulation and rapid prototyping of compliant and non-compliant Automotive devices. LibreCar based hardware is dynamically reconfigurable, so it gives you the flexibility to create any configuration for an ECU and engage in almost any (mis)behavior/hacks.     
    * Useful for researchers engaging in study of current security and bandwidth limitations of modern automotive vehicles and come up with new approach to solve them.
