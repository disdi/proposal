# TOTAL COST OF PROPOSAL

The cost of the project is divided into below categories :

* Development cost for gateware, firmware, middleware and hardware design

|Contribution                         | No. of hours |
|-------------------------------------|--------------|
|Milestone 1 -  Gateware Development  |      80      |
|Milestone 2 -  Firmware Development  |      80      |
|Milestone 3 -  Middleware Development|      80      |
|Milestone 4 -  Manufactoring         |      80      |
|      Total hours                    |     320      |


---
**Calculation for Development Cost**


Cost per Hour =	40.00 €

Total Development Cost = Cost per Hour x Total hours = 40 € x 320 =	12,800.00 €

---
**Calculation for Development Time**


Capacity per Week = 20 hours

Total Development Time =  Total hours / Capacity per Week = 320 / 20 = 16 weeks

|Hardware           |Accessories for CAN & ETHERNET|  3  |300 € |
|Total Hardware Cost|                              |     |1200 €|



* Cost of development for PCB Design and Manufactoring

|Item Type               |Name of material    |Units|Price  |
|------------------------|--------------------|-----|-------|
|Hardware                |   PCB Design       |     | 1000 €|
|Hardware                |   PCB Manufactoring|  10 | 1000 €|
|Miscellaneous           |   Excise duty      |     |  209 €|
|Miscellaneous           |   Internet Bill    |     |  450 €|
|Total Manufactoring Cost|                    |     | 2659 €|
