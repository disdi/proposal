# Introduction

The ECU is a microprocessor-based system that receives input from various sensors, analyzes the data, and controls various driving functions based on the input. LibreCar is a small and affordable device which can emulate an actual **Engine Control Unit (ECU)**, an electronic control module that manages control of an automotive vehicle.

Librecar is an all-in-one device for building, testing, monitoring, and experimenting with Automotive ECUs. Built around a unique FPGA-based architecture, Librecarâ€™s digital hardware can be fully customized to suit the application at hand. As a result, it can act as a no-compromise Automotive protocol analyzer, an Automotive-hacking multi-tool, or an Automotive development platform.

LibreCar comprises of:
* opensource hardware
    * Opensource softcore of RISC-V
    * Digital peripheral IPs for CAN and Ethernet
* opensource software
    * Device drivers for CAN and Ethernet
    * Middleware based on AUTOSAR specification for Automotive protocols

LibreCar embodies both CAN Bus (Controller Area Network) or over Automotive Ethernet Bus, a switched network used in the automotive field to enable supporting modern automotive protocols listed below: 
* **DoIP** ( Diagnostics over Internet Protocol )
* **DLT** ( Diagnostics Log and Trace ) 
* **XCP** ( Universal Measurement and Calibration Protocol )
