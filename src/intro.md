# Introduction

Libre Car Control is an opensource car control effort to enable control of modern cars facilitate the development of non-proprietary vehicle technology. It provides an interface with modern vehicleâ€™s control systems.

Developers can formulate control commands like those which determine steering wheel torque sensor, throttle position sensor, and brake position sensor. This low-level interface means that it offers full-range control to develop/hack ADAS features.
